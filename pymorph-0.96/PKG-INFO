        Summary
        -------
        
        This image morphology toolbox implements the basic binary and greyscale
        morphology operations, working with numpy arrays representing images.
        
        This is a pure Python package which is the companion package
        to the book "Hands-on Morphological Image Processing." It has been
        updated to work with numpy and the names and interfaces have been
        Pythonised.
        
        
        Includes basic operations such as
        - erode
        - dilate
        - open
        - tophat opening
        - watershed
        - ...

        Install
        -------
        
        One of
        
        ::
        
            pip install pymorph
            easy_install pymorph
        
        or download and run

        --------
        
        The package `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`_ implements some
        of the same functions in C++ and, so, it is much faster (even if it is not as
        feature-full).
        
        Status & Future Plans
        ---------------------
        
        The package is actively maintained and any reported bug will be fixed fast.
        
        Currently there are *no known bugs* (although testing coverage is not complete).
        
        When all functions have a corresponding unit test and the whole of the
        API documentation has been re-written into numpy rst format, I will release
        version 1.0.

        The original package was written by RAF and RCM. Starting June 2008 (with
        release 0.88), LPC updated the code to run on the more modern numpy base and
        started fixing bugs and maintaining the package.
